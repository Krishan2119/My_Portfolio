          <h3>Testwise</h3>
          <p>We created an application for students where they can upload their documents (PDFs, Word, PPTs, etc), and then
            ananalysis of their document will be done using Al and uploaded to a separate page that they can access using the
            navbar A student will get an entire summary of their document and the option to generate more questions and get
            further explanations of that topic. If a student uploads a document comprising of questions then our application
            using Al will solve those questions </p>

          <h3>Stone Paper Scissors Game</h3>
          <p>We developed an online  game Stone Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a user-friendly interface where players can compete against the computer. The game includes score tracking, responsive animations, and a randomized AI opponent to make each round engaging and unpredictable. It was a great project to practice DOM manipulation and basic game logic in JavaScript.</p>

          <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
          <p>A fully interactive Tic Tac Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game allows two players to compete in a simple but addictive 3x3 grid game. It includes win detection, draw scenarios, and a restart option. The project helped me dive deeper into conditional logic and managing game state efficiently on the frontend.</p>
